## Equipment/Ingredients

### Equipment

- Wood chips
- Remote probe thermometer
- Oven pan
- Rack to sit over oven pan
- Aluminum foil
- Tongs

## Ingredients 
- Steak, duh
- Kosher salt
- Avocado oil

## Cooking

We're going to be reverse searing.  That means cooking the steak at low heat in an oven
and then transfering to a pan or grill to blast the outside of the steak with high heat 
to create a nice "crust" (see [[1]](#1) for more information on why).

### Prior to Cooking
2 hours before you plan on putting the steak in the oven take the steak out of the fridge
and smother both sides with kosher salt.  Can you see red/pink? you don't have enough, add more.
Place on a rack over an oven pan (it's going to drip a lot of liquid). Place a probe thermometer
as close to center wrt height, and centered wrt outer edges.

Flip after 1 hour

30 min before cooking heat the oven to 200 degrees

10 min before cooking wipe off all the salt off the steak

### Cooking

Rub the steak in avocado oil and place in 200 degree oven 

Once the steak reaches an internal temperature of 100 degrees start the grill and get it as hot as possible (lid dowwn) 

Once the steak reaches an internal temperature of 115 degrees, Remove from the oven and transfer to the grill.

Grill each side for 1 minute. Set a timer


### Post Cooking

Once the steak has been seared on both sides (2 min total) it needs to rest [[2]](#2) remove from the grill and wrap in foil

After 10 min of resting the internal temperature of the steak should be 137.5 
If it's lower than 130, throw it back on the grill for an additional minute on each side 
for each 5 degrees below 137.5 and allow it to rest for another 5-10 minutes.

Cut the meat Gagainst the the grain (the short way not the long way across the steak) into 
finger width portions

## Notes

- After cutting, adding some clarified butter is a nice touch
- Add any pepper after resting
